## How to Install
#### 1. Download and copy into Toolkit folder.
#### 2. Edit *AppDeployToolkitExtensions.ps1* file and add the following lines.
#### 3. Create an empty array (only once if multiple extensions):
```PowerShell
## Variables: Extensions to load
$ExtensionToLoad = @()
```
#### 4. Add Extension Path and Script filename (repeat for multiple extensions):
```PowerShell
$ExtensionToLoad += [PSCustomObject]@{
	Path   = "PSADT.WIMFile"
	Script = "WIMFileExtension.ps1"
}
```
#### 5. Complete with the remaining code to load the extension (only once if multiple extensions):
```PowerShell
## Loading extensions
foreach ($Extension in $ExtensionToLoad) {
	$ExtensionPath = $null
	if ($Extension.Path) {
		[IO.FileInfo]$ExtensionPath = Join-Path -Path $scriptRoot -ChildPath $Extension.Path | Join-Path -ChildPath $Extension.Script
	}
	else {
		[IO.FileInfo]$ExtensionPath = Join-Path -Path $scriptRoot -ChildPath $Extension.Script
	}
	if ($ExtensionPath.Exists) {
		try {
			. $ExtensionPath
		}
		catch {
			Write-Log -Message "An error occurred while trying to load the extension file [$($ExtensionPath)].`r`n$(Resolve-Error)" -Severity 3 -Source $appDeployToolkitExtName
		}
	}
	else {
		Write-Log -Message "Unable to locate the extension file [$($ExtensionPath)]." -Severity 2 -Source $appDeployToolkitExtName
